Sample Behavioral Interview Questions

Example questions include:
 
* Tell me about a difficult work challenge you’ve had.
* Have you ever been in an ethically questionable business situation?
* Have you ever had a project that had to change drastically while it was in progress?
* Talk about a time when you’ve had to sell an idea to your colleagues.
* Tell me about a major setback you’ve had.
* Talk about a time where you had to make an important decision quickly.
* Have you ever had a deadline you were not able to meet?
* Talk about a time when you had to adapt to significant changes at work.
* Have you ever had to convince your team to do a job they were reluctant to do?
* How have you dealt with an angry or upset customer?
